Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm to find a shortest path from one vertex to another vertex.
The algorithm picks a vertex with least cost from an open set which can be added to the closed set and we can claim
that the picked vertex states the shortest path from source to itself.
The algorithm ends once the destination vertex is added to the closed set or when the open set is empty.
We use a data structure called min heap to efficiently get the least cost vertex in the open set.

Programming
use of c++ template
I use a class template to represent node in the priority queue, aka heap. a node can be an integer, a string or something
else. with c++ class template, it is possible to store generic type objects in the heap and use functions that can operate
with generic type, which is good for code reuse.

use of friend function
a friend function can access private field of a class. It is convenient especially for print purpose.

function overloading
operator << is overloaded in the implementation for print purpose. It is used as a friend function of a given class.
The code is more readable by function overloading.
