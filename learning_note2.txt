Prim's algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm by picking shortest edge locally.
1.Prim's algorithm starts from one vertex and puts it into a closed set.
2.Add edges connected to this vertex to an open set which is maintained by a min heap.
3.Pick the shortest edge in the min heap and add the other end to the closed set.
4.repeat step 1,2,3 by starting from the other end which is newly added to the closed set in step 3.
5.Finish until all vertices are in the closed set.
